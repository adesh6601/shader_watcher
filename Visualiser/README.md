# Computer Graphics Projects
This repository encompasses six distinct projects, each contributing to various aspects of computer graphics and geometric algorithms. Here's a brief overview of each project:

## 1. Hermite Curve Implementation
Overview
C++ implementation of a cubic Hermite curve, widely used in computer graphics and animation for creating smooth paths with predefined tangent vectors.

## 2. BSpline Curve Implementation
Overview
C++ implementation of a cubic B-Spline curve, providing a mathematical representation defined by four control points.

## 3. Geometry
Overview
This project contains essential geometric entities such as Point, Line, and Rectangle, serving as the foundation for other graphics implementations.

## 4. Simple DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
Overview
A graphical application developed in C++ using the Qt framework with OpenGL, providing a visualization tool for drawing lines within a grid using the Simple DDA Line Drawing Algorithm.

## 5. Bezier Curve Implementation
Overview
C++ implementation of a cubic Bezier curve, a mathematical curve passing through endpoints and utilizing two additional points to calculate the convex hull.

## 6. Symmetric DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
Overview
A graphical application developed in C++ using the Qt framework with OpenGL, providing a visualization tool for drawing lines within a grid using the Symmetric DDA Line Drawing Algorithm.
